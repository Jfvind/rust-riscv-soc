# rust-riscv-soc
Allows you to run rust code on your FPGA through a Wildcat Risc-V.


## :shopping_cart: Prerequisites & Installation

### :rocket: Running Rust on the CPU
_Everything you need to write Rust programs and execute them on the FPGA._

#### 1. Make (Build Tool)
Required to run the automation scripts.

**Check if installed:**
```bash
make --version
```
If you see a version number, Make is already installed — skip to the next tool. If not, proceed with installation:

- Windows:
    - Option A (Recommended): Install via Chocolatey. Open PowerShell as Admin and run: ```choco install make```
    - Option B: Download GnuWin32 Make, install it, and add C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin to your PATH.
- Linux:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: ```sudo apt install make```
    - Fedora: ```sudo dnf install make```

#### 2. Xilinx Vivado (WebPACK Edition) !!Only needed if softcore is not already flashed to board!!
Required for synthesizing the hardware and flashing the FPGA. Only needed once to program the non-volatile flash.

**Check if installed:**
```bash
vivado -version
```
If you see version information, Vivado is already installed and in your PATH — skip to the next tool. If the command is not found, proceed with installation:

- **Download:** Xilinx Unified Installer
- **Install:** Select "Vivado Standard" or "WebPACK" (Free).
- **Important:** During installation, ensure you install the Cable Drivers.
- **System PATH:** After installation, add the Vivado bin folder to your system PATH so the terminal can find the *vivado* command.
    - *Windows:* Add `C:\Xilinx\Vivado\20xx.x\bin` to Environment Variables → Path.
    - *Linux:* Add `source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/20xx.x/settings64.sh` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

#### 3. Rust Toolchain
Required to compile the Rust program that runs on the FPGA.

**Check if installed:**
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
If both commands show version numbers, Rust is already installed — verify the RISC-V target is added by running `rustc --print sysroot` and search the folder for `riscv32i-unknown-none-elf`. If Rust is not installed, proceed with installation:

- **Install rustup:** [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
- **Add the RISC-V 32-bit target:**
    ```bash
    rustup target add riscv32i-unknown-none-elf
    ```
- **Install cargo-binutils** (for `cargo objcopy`):
    ```bash
    cargo install cargo-binutils
    rustup component add llvm-tools
    ```

### :wrench: Developing on the CPU
_Additional tools needed to modify the CPU hardware (Chisel) and run simulation tests._

#### 4. Java 17+ (JDK)
Required by sbt and the Chisel hardware generator.

**Check if installed:**
```bash
java -version
```
If you see a version number that is 17 or higher (e.g., `17.0.x`, `21.0.x`), Java is installed — skip to the next tool. If not found or version is lower than 17, proceed with installation:

- Windows/Linux: Download from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) (Eclipse Temurin 17+).
- Linux (Ubuntu): ```sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk```
- Verify: ```java -version```

#### 5. sbt (Scala Build Tool)
Required to compile Chisel (`make generate-verilog`) and run simulation tests (`make sim-test`).

**Check if installed:**
```bash
sbt --version
```
If you see a version number, sbt is already installed — skip to the next tool. If not found, proceed with installation:

- All platforms: Follow the install guide at [scala-sbt.org](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
- Linux (Ubuntu): ```sudo apt install sbt``` (after adding the sbt apt repository).
- Verify: ```sbt --version```

#### 6. RISC-V Assembler/Linker
Required to assemble the simulation test programs (`make sim-test`). Not needed for building or flashing the FPGA.

**Check if installed:**

- **Windows (inside WSL):**
  ```bash
  wsl riscv64-linux-gnu-as --version
  ```
- **Linux:**
  ```bash
  riscv64-unknown-elf-as --version  # or
  riscv64-linux-gnu-as --version
  ```
If you see version information, the RISC-V tools are installed — skip to the next section. If not found, proceed with installation:

- **Windows:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with the linux-gnu binutils:
    1. Install WSL (from an admin PowerShell): `wsl --install`
    2. Inside WSL: `sudo apt-get install -y make binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu`
- **Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+):** `sudo apt-get install -y binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu`
- **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 and earlier):** `sudo apt-get install -y gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf`

## :rocket: Getting started
After boot, the program prints "PASS" over UART and demonstrates all peripherals:
- **ADC bar-graph:** Onboard LEDs 0-6 light up as a bar-graph based on the first JXADC analaog input
- **Buttons:** btnU, btnL, btnR, light up Pmod LEDs 8, 9, 10 respectively.
- **RGB LED (PWM):** Pmod pins 12-14 drive a common-anode RGB LED that fades through red, green, and blue

**Note:** When CPU is running, LED 7 (leftmost onboard) is lit as a status indicator.

The test circuit below is the hardware setup used by the code currently running in [sw/program/src/main.rs](sw/program/src/main.rs).

### Memory Map

| Address        | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `0x0000_0000`  | Scratchpad RAM (4 KB)                            |
| `0xF000_0000`  | UART status (bit 0 = TX ready, bit 1 = RX ready)|
| `0xF000_0004`  | UART data (read = RX, write = TX)                |
| `0xF010_0000`  | LED register (bit 0-6 = LED 0-6, bit 7 = CPU running indicator (read-only), bit 8-15 = LED 8-15) |
| `0xF020_0000`  | Button register (bit 0-3 = btnU, btnL, btnR, btnD, read-only) |
| `0xF030_0000`  | Base address for JXADC analog inputs, offset for four total inputs (e.g. `0xF030_0004`) |
| `0xF040_0000`  | PWM enable bitmask (bit N = 1 → LED N is PWM-controlled, bit 7 ignored) |
| `0xF040_0004`  | PWM duty cycle for LED 0 (0-255, 8-bit)                          |
| `0xF040_0008` — `0xF040_0044`  | PWM duty cycle for LED 1-15 (same format, offset 4 bytes per channel) |

### 1. Clone repo (requires git) OR download release zip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jfvind/rust-riscv-soc
cd rust-riscv-soc
```
### 2. Flash
Build RustSoCTop.bin from wildcat/src/main/scala/rvsoc/RustSoCTop.scala and flash to Basys3
- **Dependency:** Make sure Basys3 is connected and turned on (And 'Prerequisites & Installation' is completed) and your terminal is in /rust-riscv-soc
```bash
make flash
```
- **Duration:** 3 minutes to a lifetime :skull:
- **Output:** 
    - Makes a Vivado project at hw/vivado
    - Generates .jou and .log in root
    - Generates /.Xil in root
- *Note*: it is possible to only build the .bin and .bit files using `make build`, this doesn't flash the FPGA memory.

### :arrow_forward: 3. PROG
Press the red button in top right corner of the Basys3.
After 5-10 seconds the CPU should be running on the FPGA, stored in the non-volatile memory.

### 🔌 4. Upload Rust
**First:** locate the comport you FPGA uses to connect to the pc:
*Windows:* 
```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class Ports -PresentOnly | Select-Object -Property FriendlyName
```
Look for something like "USB Serial Port (COM5)". Port name is COM5.

*Linux:*
```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* 2>/dev/null
```
Look for something like /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1.

**Note:** If you don't know which port is your FPGA, then unplug it, run the command, and plug it in again and run the command once more.

**Second:** Upload rust code
```bash
make upload SERIAL_PORT=<your_COM_port>
```
**Note:** You can re-upload anytime after changin the rust file and then running ```make upload``` again.

### :broom: 5. Clean up (Optional)
Since the CPU is stored in the flash memory, the generated files are not necessary.
**Note:** if making changes to the CPU and the hw/vivado is cleaned away, then *make flash* will take longer.

# rust-riscv-soc
Allows you to run rust code on your FPGA through a Wildcat Risc-V


## :shopping_cart: Prerequisites & Installation

### :rocket: Running Rust on the CPU
_Everything you need to write Rust programs and execute them on the FPGA._

#### 1. Make (Build Tool)
Required to run the automation scripts.

- Windows:
    - Option A (Recommended): Install via Chocolatey. Open PowerShell as Admin and run: ```choco install make```
    - Option B: Download GnuWin32 Make, install it, and add C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin to your PATH.
- Linux:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: ```sudo apt install make```
    - Fedora: ```sudo dnf install make```

#### 2. Xilinx Vivado (WebPACK Edition)
Required for synthesizing the hardware and flashing the FPGA. Only needed once to program the non-volatile flash.

- **Download:** Xilinx Unified Installer
- **Install:** Select "Vivado Standard" or "WebPACK" (Free).
- **Important:** During installation, ensure you install the Cable Drivers.
- **System PATH:** After installation, add the Vivado bin folder to your system PATH so the terminal can find the *vivado* command.
    - *Windows:* Add `C:\Xilinx\Vivado\20xx.x\bin` to Environment Variables → Path.
    - *Linux:* Add `source /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/20xx.x/settings64.sh` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

#### 3. Rust Toolchain
Required to compile the Rust program that runs on the FPGA.

- **Install rustup:** [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
- **Add the RISC-V 32-bit target:**
    ```bash
    rustup target add riscv32i-unknown-none-elf
    ```
- **Install cargo-binutils** (for `cargo objcopy`):
    ```bash
    cargo install cargo-binutils
    rustup component add llvm-tools
    ```

#### 4. Python 3
Required for the UART upload script.

- Windows/Linux: Download from [python.org](https://python.org).
- Install the serial library:
    ```bash
    pip install pyserial
    ```

#### 5. Git
Required for cloning this repository.

- Download: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

---

### :wrench: Developing on the CPU
_Additional tools needed to modify the CPU hardware (Chisel) and run simulation tests._

#### 6. Java 17+ (JDK)
Required by sbt and the Chisel hardware generator.

- Windows/Linux: Download from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) (Eclipse Temurin 17+).
- Linux (Ubuntu): ```sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk```
- Verify: ```java -version```

#### 7. sbt (Scala Build Tool)
Required to compile Chisel (`make generate-verilog`) and run simulation tests (`make sim-test`).

- All platforms: Follow the install guide at [scala-sbt.org](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
- Linux (Ubuntu): ```sudo apt install sbt``` (after adding the sbt apt repository).
- Verify: ```sbt --version```

#### 8. RISC-V Assembler/Linker
Required to assemble the simulation test programs (`make sim-test`). Not needed for building or flashing the FPGA.

- **Windows:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with the linux-gnu binutils:
    1. Install WSL (from an admin PowerShell): `wsl --install`
    2. Inside WSL: `sudo apt-get install -y make binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu`
- **Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+):** `sudo apt-get install -y binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu`
- **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 and earlier):** `sudo apt-get install -y gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf`

## :rocket: Getting started
For now a simple program turns on one LED, sends "PASS" and turn on the eigth rightmost LEDs. 
**Note:** When CPU is running, the leftmost LED is lit.

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jfvind/rust-riscv-soc
cd rust-riscv-soc
```
### 2. Flash
Build RustSoCTop.bin from wildcat/src/main/scala/rvsoc/RustSoCTop.scala and flash to Basys3
- **Dependency:** Make sure Basys3 is connected and turned on (And 'Prerequisites & Installation' is completed)
```bash
make flash
```
- **Duration:** 3 minutes to a lifetime :skull:
- **Output:** 
    - Makes a Vivado project at hw/vivado
    - Generates .jou and .log in root
    - Generates /.Xil in root
- *Note*: it is possible to only build the .bin and .bit files using `make build`, this doesn't flash the FPGA memory.

### :arrow_forward: 3. PROG
Press the red button in top right corner of the Basys3.
After 5-10 seconds the CPU should be running on the FPGA, stored in the non-volatile memory.

### 🔌 4. Upload Rust
**First:** locate the comport you FPGA uses to connect to the pc:
*Windows:* 
```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class Ports -PresentOnly | Select-Object -Property FriendlyName
```
Look for something like "USB Serial Port (COM5)". Port name is COM5.

*Linux:*
```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* 2>/dev/null
```
Look for something like /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1.

**Note:** If you don't know which port is your FPGA, then unplug it, run the command, and plug it in again and run the command once more.

**Second:** Upload rust code
```bash
make upload
```
**Note:** You can re-upload anytime after changin the rust file and then running ```make upload``` again.

### :broom: 5. Clean up (Optional)
Since the CPU is stored in the flash memory, the generated files are not necessary.
**Note:** if making changes to the CPU and the hw/vivado is cleaned away, then *make flash* will take longer.

## Changes to schoeberl/wildcat
Static version from feb-2026.

- Added top module instantiating bootloader at src/main/scala/rvsoc.
- Added WSL detection in src/main/scala/Util.scala for running tests in powershell.
- Changed calling of make app to correct path for powershell calling (SimulatorTest, SingleCycleTest, WildcatTest, WildcatTestUart).
- Added WSL detection in Makefile for binary compilation (riscv64 toolchain).
